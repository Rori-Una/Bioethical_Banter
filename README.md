# Bioethical Banter
## What The Project Is
The Bioethical Banter is an meant to be a web application with AI integeration used to aid in the decision making of conservation management planning. 
## How It Works
The user is presented with a conservation bioethical dilemma and is able to give a response as to how they would go about addressing the issue. The user can then save their response and opt to see the AI assistant's response to the same ethical dilemma prompt. The user can then use the AI response to aid in their brainstorming, planning and decision making with regards to addressing the ethical dilemma and implementing best conservation practices. 
In the management planning page the user can write up plans, take quick notes, add to-do tasks and link research papers in order to keep track of their management plan. 
The aim of the project is not to give a right or wrong answer to ethical dilemmas, rather it is to assist conservationists, researchers, policy makers etc. in their planning processes.
